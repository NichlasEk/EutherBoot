# Validation · 2026-10-10 · Configuration milestone

Host: Rust 1.99.0, QEMU 11.1.2 TCG/q35, ordinary OVMF, x86_64 UEFI target.
This is virtual-development evidence, not physical hardware or OS boot evidence.

## Shared parser and builds

Nine Rust tests cover menu wrap/empty state, the example and safe defaults,
non-first defaults, positive timeouts, malformed TOML, unknown/duplicate fields,
bad types/ranges/themes, duplicate IDs and case-insensitive paths, unsupported
entry types, traversal/aliases, display controls/Unicode and resource bounds.
The host CLI validates the same example with the same no_std parser as firmware.
Both real PE32+ EFI executables build with Cargo.lock, including the parser.

## OVMF matrix

`./scripts/test.sh` builds/tests and runs **20 independent QEMU cases**. Each has
its own generated FAT directory and firmware-variable copy, with no attached
host disks or networking. At most three VMs run concurrently. Test steps have
deadlines; an outer timeout interrupts the runner/VM process group.

| Cases | Count | Verified outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sample, successful child at 1024×768 and 640×480 | 2 | TOML-loaded EFI target starts and returns; menu restored |
| Child ABORTED, missing child, invalid child | 3 | Error retained on menu, no unintended target or retry |
| Non-first configured default | 1 | Selection 1 loads a relocated child by its configured path |
| 3s timeout | 1 | Default starts once after the delay; return never rearms it |
| Any-key cancellation | 1 | Unhandled `x` cancels timeout; later explicit Enter works |
| Timeout into missing default | 1 | NOT_FOUND once; no automatic fallback/retry |
| Sixteen configured entries at both resolutions | 2 | Page navigation reaches entry 16, starts correct child and reaches built-ins |
| Missing configuration | 1 | Read error, no configured entries or timer |
| Malformed TOML, unknown field, duplicate ID, unresolved default, traversal | 5 | Entire config rejected; diagnostics and firmware return work |
| Invalid UTF-8, oversize input, direct self-reference | 3 | Entire config rejected before any child starts |

The original five chainload cases each perform three explicit attempts in one
VM, including text mode. Positive configuration cases move the child away from
the original fixed path; the selected target log and actual child execution
prove the config path is used. The first non-default entry points to a missing
file, making accidental selection observable. Timeout tests check a 3-second
interval with host-observation tolerance and wait past the deadline again after
return/failure to reject unintended rearming. Invalid configs request a 1-second
timeout where syntactically possible; tests wait beyond it and require no load.

Screenshots confirm the configured default highlight, error diagnostics and the
last page at 640×480. Pixel comparisons verify the graphical menu is reconstructed
after the child clears the display. Text tests check new console output and
subsequent keyboard navigation, not just log markers. Returning child handles
no longer expose LoadedImage; this is not a complete memory-leak audit.

Reproduce individual cases through `scripts/qemu.py --help`. Evidence is ignored
under `artifacts/qemu-<width>x<height>-<scenario>-<config-case>/`: debug.log,
serial.log, qemu.log and PPM captures. `.efi` artifacts and SHA256SUMS are rebuilt
by scripts/build.sh. The example config is copied read-only from EutherBoot's
perspective; no runtime disk writes or firmware-variable writes were introduced.

## Limits

No real OS, physical machine, Secure Boot rejection, nonempty child ExitData,
initrd/kernel command line, multiple ESP discovery, editor save or persistent
preferences have been demonstrated. Input is polled; the timeout itself uses a
firmware timer. Timer creation/check failures and allocation exhaustion are
handled but not fault-injected. Automatic GOP failure fallback is not injected;
manual text fallback is tested. Only printable ASCII labels/paths are supported.
The virtual filesystem is directory-backed FAT, not a GPT-enumeration test.
See ARCHITECTURE.md for loader cleanup and self-copy limitations.
